# eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)
I have passed the eJPT exam on December 15th 2022.

I did not create notes for this certification as it is more practical than theoretical, so as preparation I did the following:
- I have already a good understanding of netwarking and linux, so I did not need to study for that.
- I created an account on HackTheBox and did the free tier machines.
- I did all the easy machines on HackTheBox at the time.

# CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)
I am currently preparing for the CKA exam, I will update this page once I pass it.

Here is the notes that I am creating for this certification (Not Finished Yet): [cka_notes](/post/cka_notes/)

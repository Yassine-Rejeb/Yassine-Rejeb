I'm a Cybersecurity graduate with a strong focus on Linux cloud infrastructure and DevSecOps. Over the years, I’ve built a solid foundation through certifications like RHCSA, RHCE, AWS CCP, and eJPT, alongside hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes. I’ve worked on practical projects, including setting up secure CI/CD pipelines, load balancers, and WAFs, which helped me dive deeper into the technical aspects of securing systems.

I’m always eager to learn and enjoy taking on technical challenges like CTFs, especially in offensive security and pwn categories. Staying up-to-date with cybersecurity and cloud trends is something I prioritize, whether through personal projects, community engagement, or simply experimenting with new tools and techniques.

I’m passionate about contributing to meaningful projects, learning from others, and sharing what I know. If you're into Linux, cloud, or cybersecurity, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
